windows.wndstory.sewers=You walk down the city street looking for somewhere to steal from. You look around and see an expensive looking jewelry shop. The jewelry is obviously displayed for display's sake, not to mention it is way too expensive.\n\nThe city is filled with soldiers. You aren't sure what their exact purpose is, but from your observations they mostly patrol the city streets.
windows.wndstory.prison=You walk into the prison and are immediately taken into a small room by three guards. One of them says, "You the one that killed Frank?"\n\nYou reply, "Yeah, I am."\n\nThe guard says, "Well we are having some problems with another prisoner and we would like you to help break him out."\n\nYou ask, "How?"\n\nThe guard explains, "We need you to kill the prisoner, steal his keys and open up the cell doors for the others. Then you just need to get a gag, rope and a torch and help our friend climb out the window."
windows.wndstory.caves=You decide to sneak into one of the many caves in the area. You walk down to a cave and light your torch. The cave isn't very big but it is dark. You walk further in and find a couple of chamber. You hear some noise and you go to investigate.\n\nYou see a small group of goblins. One of them says, "Ha ha! I caught a human!" The goblins start laughing and mocking you. Mocking you say, "What is your name little one?"\n\nYou mumble, "Z...Zheka."\n\nThey laugh and one says, "Ha ha! You insolent scum, you should be killed!" The goblins jeeringly taunt you and ask where you came from. You don't say anything and stop toying with you.
windows.wndstory.city=The dwarves laugh again and one says, "The Dwarf King will give the orders, let's take them back to the city."\n\nZheka tries to resist but one draws a dagger and stabs him in the throat with it. The dwarves grab Zheka and begin dragging him away. You move to attack the dwarf that stabbed Zheka but another one draws a dagger and cuts you across the chest. You drop your sword and catch the dwarf in a headlock and start punching him. The dwarfes try to pull you away but the rest of them draw their weapons and attack you. They fight back and a few manage to wound you in the hand, arm and leg. You let go of the dwarf you were fighting and pull out your dagger. You stab the dwarf in the neck, just as the king said a dwarf would.\n\nThe dwarfes become frantic and start attacking one another. They don't last long in a fair fight. The others quickly retreat deeper into the cave to escape your pursuit. You chase them down and keep stabbing them until you make it back to the city. The watchmen there cheer and congratulate you. The Captain shakes your hand and tells you that you have made a great contribution to the city. Zheka is carried past you on a stretcher, he is dead.
windows.wndstory.halls=When you are done the king seems to have genuine concern on his face. You are taken back to your room and told to rest, as tomorrow you are going back to work. The king has a lot to think about.\n\nThat night you have a scary dream. You are back in hell, but this time it's a city. There are thousands of people there screaming and burning in pain. You see the demon prison and you walk up to a gate. A voice from within cries out, "Zheka, open!" The gate opens and Zheka is free. He runs over and hugs you, but you are burning up. Zheka asks what you need him to do now. You ask him to kill everyone. He agrees but asks why you would want that to happen. You explain that it's because they don't want freedom and that they are the enemy. Zheka seems pretty happy with that goal.
