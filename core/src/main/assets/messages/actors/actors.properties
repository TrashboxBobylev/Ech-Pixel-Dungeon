actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_berry=The old warden of this prison kept a _rotberry plant,_ and I'm after one of its seeds. The plant has probably gone wild by now though, so getting it to give up a seed might be tricky. Its garden should be somewhere around here.

actors.mobs.demonspawner.desc=This twisting amalgam of dwarven flesh is responsible for creating ripper demons from the dwarves that have died in this region.

actors.mobs.dm100.desc=The DM-100 is an early model of dwarven 'defense machine' which was designed to protect dwarven miners in the caves below this prison.

They are much larger and bulkier than their predecessors, and attack with devastating hydraulic fists.\n\nTheir increased size is also their primary weakness, as they are unable to fit into the narrow tunnels and doorways of the dungeon.

The DM-201 is a retrofitted DM-200 which acts as a sentry turret that has no movement ability. In exchange for the lack of mobility, DM-201s have significantly more durability and attacking power.\n\nAs DM-201s have no engine to vent exhaust from, the dwarves instead outfitted them with corrosive gas grenades! DM-201s are careful with these grenades however, and will only lob them when attacked from a distance.

DM-300 can also connect to an energy grid, further enhancing its power.

Additionally, its drill now spins fast enough for it to _tunnel through solid rock,_ though it moves much more slowly when doing this.\n\nAttacking DM-300 directly is pointless while it is supercharged, but _something in the area must be providing it with this energy,_ destroying that may weaken it.
